GDARIM 
(Dynamic resource assignment for multiple resources with complex and competitive restrictions)

Description: prototype classrooms to optimize allocation of university resources (scheduling, classroom spaces, specific inputs, etc...) and to assign subjects to different classrooms and teachers. 
The prototype is demonstrative and requires adaptation for each entity. 
This system is intended for automatic classroom allocation using several restrictions such as professor availability, hardware/software requirements, etc. It implements a powerful genetic algorithm known as Epsilon-MOEA (Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm) to optimize space allocation (maximum number of students) and classroom allocation (minimum number of classroom to be used) at the same time. It also provides some extra restrictions such as:

Maximum occupation rate 
Minimum classroom rotation
Minimum faculty site rotation
